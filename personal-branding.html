<h1><u>Intro to Your Own Brand</u></h1>
<p>Business applications build a bridge with connections in the industry but the biggest hurdle is creating your personal brand. When we mention personal brand, we are talking about yourself, who you are, and what you have to offer.  There are many ways that people take to get connections but fail due to not knowing who they actually are and what they want. Marketing yourself comes with big discipline, you have to be ready to keep your audience engaged at all times. Identifying who you are is the first step into building your personal brand because that is how you are going to present yourself to other companies or people. With your personal brand comes managing your name, one of my favorite quotes comes from Tim Ferriss and he says, “Personal branding is about managing your name-even if you don’t own a business-in a world of misinformation, disinformation...Chances are that your ‘blind’ date has googled your name. Going to a job interview? Ditto”. This quote shows the importance of maintaining discipline and understanding who you are and what you are pursuing because you never know what happens in the background of other things, you have to take care of the responsibilities that you are in your power, and once you do everything else will fall into place. </p>

<h1><u>How to Market Your Brand</u></h1>
<p>Now you may ask, how do I market myself? Well there’s not just one way, there’s multiple ways. Building a community within you is a good step because you have a lot of people to vouch for who you are, and to build your reputation on a foundation. Everyone has room for growth, so make sure you identify the areas you need to grow as well. An important must for marketing yourself is to find your niche. Not only does your niche help you clarify for others, but it sends your message more directly. Social media plays a huge part into what the world revolves around and it’s important to take advantage of the free apps that help you get into that position, such as LinkedIn, Youtube, Podcasts, Twitter, Instagram, any other app that gives you access to other people and platforms to build your name. A quote comes from Michael Stelzner writing about a huge struggle that people face, and he says, “Nowadays it’s easier than ever to market yourself, but people still struggle. First, they procrastinate, they think their Youtube videos have to be perfect...they can’t or shouldn’t be sharing personal things on social media because it’s public…”. Now this quote actually circles around the whole subject of fear. We as people hide from our fears and let nervousness take us over, and that is not how big marketing happens, the best marketers overcome their fears. As I mentioned above, it is easy enough to make connections, but the biggest part is putting everything into action and addressing it because hard work is the only way to grow yourself, and to stamp a name in this society. </p>
